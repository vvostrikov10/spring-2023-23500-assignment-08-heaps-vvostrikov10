* Project 8 - Heaps 

* Due Date: Monday 5/22 7:00am

* files

- This project requires:
  - A Makefile
  - Doctest based tests
  - At least three targets in the Makefile
    1. main (program executable)
    2. tests (doctest tests executable)
    3. clean (remove the .o files) 
    
* Resources

* Specifications

Write a program that includes a function *heapsort(int data[])*. This
routine should implement the heapsort algorithm to sort the input
array. It should:

1. Turn the array int a heap using the algorithm we outlined in class
   and by using the parent/child relationship so that the array
   *becomes* the heap.
2. Perform the heapsort as described in class using the end of the
   array to hold the values as they become sorted.
  
 
The second video under resources talks through a cool algorithm using
heaps. It isn't needed for the assignment but I strongly recommend you
view it when you get a chance.
